# Call-Recording-Solutions

Different approaches for Call Recording on Android

# Signed roms and unsigned roms

The first main difference we have is between signed roms either by LineageOS or by a dev that is making personal builds signed by self.

# Magisk

A very good and clean Magisk module to do call recording is BCR:

# LSPosed framework:

Another approach is using LSPosed, by hooking com.android.dialer

Currently supported only up to LineageOS 19.1, it is probably the best solution to avoid third-party.

Various modded dialers are around:
